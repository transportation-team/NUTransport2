            <p>
                The L train is a train system serving Chicago, Evanston, and 
                other surrounding suburbs. The purple line goes near the  
                Northwestern Evanston campus and continues down through downtown 
                Evanston to Howard St, where the red line begins and goes to the  
                center of Chicago, the loop, where riders can make connections to 
                anywhere in the city. Riders need a Ventra card, which costs a 
                reimbursable $5.00, and each ride costs $2.50. 
                Transfers between train lines are free. A trip to downtown 
                Chicago can take 40-60 minutes.

            <p>
                The Metra train is a train system in the Chicagoland area 
                and nearby counties. Riders can use it to get around 
                Evanston, down to Chicago, and more. Tickets are priced 
                based on distance traveled. Single use tickets, 
                multiple ride tickets, or monthly passes can be 
                purchased. Students can catch the Metra train
                on Davis Street in Evanston. A trip to downtown Chicago 
                can take 20-30 minutes.

            <p>
                The CTA bus system is the public bus system in Chicago 
                and surrounding suburbs. Like the L Train, it also 
                takes ventra cards for payment. Riders can buy single 
                use tickets or single/multiple day passes. A single ride 
                costs $2.25. Riders can also transfer for two additional 
                rides for $.25

            <p>
                The Northwestern campus shuttles are free private 
                buses for Northwestern students and faculty. The 
                main shuttles include the Campus Loop, Evanston Loop, 
                Intercampus, and Shop 'n Ride. Riders must bring a 
                wildcard to get on. The campus loop goes around the 
                Evanston campus while the Evanston Loop goes around 
                the campus and the downtown Evanston area. The Intercampus 
                makes few stops along Sheridan and Chicago St and then 
                goes to the Ward building in Chicago. The Shop 'n Ride 
                goes around the Evanston Campus and then travels to 
                Target, Old Orchard, Best Buy, Jewel, and other shopping areas.
